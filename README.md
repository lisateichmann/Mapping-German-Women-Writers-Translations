# "Visualizing German women writers' translations in geographic space"
Webinar for "Connecting Women Writers with Digital Tools", 21.03.2024

In the webinar I wish to explore women writer’s translational trajectories drawing on digital humanities tools I developed for my thesis project with the aim to not only making translations by women writers visible, but also investigating what happens when the absence of an author’s work in the global field of literature becomes visible. Hence, I want to invite participants to reflect on women writers’ presence versus absence and their visualization using digital tools. Further, I wish to discuss to what extend the geographic and network tools contribute toward an understanding of women writers’ book history and the implications for critical archival studies.
